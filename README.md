### [Intune Scripts](https://github.com/RovxBot/IntuneScripts)
A collection of PowerShell scripts that I've developed over time to automate various tasks in **Microsoft Intune**. These scripts have proven useful in managing deployments for a range of clients.

### Intune Configuration as Code (WIP)
An ongoing project where Iâ€™m applying DevOps practices to **Intune**. The aim is to automate configuration management using version-controlled YAML files and deployment pipelines. Currently a private project, but itâ€™s progressing fast!

### [Teams Telephony Configuration](https://github.com/RovxBot/TeamsPhonePolicy)
